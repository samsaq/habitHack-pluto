  dialouge:
  - "You: Hey I\u2019m Alex, saw your art, looks.. Unique.."
  - 'Taylor: Oh, thanks..?'
  - "My name\u2019s Taylor by the way, that art you\u2019re talking about is actually
    a concept I\u2019m working on improving"
  - "You: That\u2019s pretty nice, but I\u2019d just say you might want to fix those
    strokes, they look kinda tacky."
  - "If I were you I\u2019d get some more professional help."
  - Not great... You came off judgemental, and put Taylor in a strained, nearly upset
    state.
  - You might mean well, but that was an awkward way to go about giving feedback,
    and leaves Taylor in a bad position.
  - Next time, you might want to be more cautious with your words, and wait for a
    more opprotune time.
